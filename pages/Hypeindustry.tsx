                        Experiencing the process of buying and selling in bulk: footwear, apparel
                        etc... since early 2002 we ve encountered issues and restrictions , we
                        also faced lots of question from sellers and buyers, shipping issues etc...
                        But at the end of this journey, we are now providing answers and
                        solutions that will help our network and partners!</Text>
